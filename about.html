<div class="about-content">

  <p>I am a designer that loves working with people on projects that serve real user needs. My practice spans over 15 years working with a range of clients from non-profits, small businesses, and startups, to universities, multicultural institutions, and Fortune 500 companies. The majority of that work has taken the form of digital products, services, and platforms.</p>

  <p>My expertise and interests sit at the intersection of digital product and user experience design, research, and strategy. I aim to leverage these disciplines to serve real user needs in a simple yet elegant way.</p>

  <p>I am currently in the midst of opening a <a href="#">new practice</a>. Previously, I lead a design team at <a href="#">Automattic</a>, the makers of WordPress, working across our portfolio of products on user research and user experience design initiatives. Prior to that I worked as a senior user experience designer and digital product lead at <a href="#">Fastspot</a> and <a href="#">Readmill</a>, respectively.</p>

  <p>I received my MFA in Graphic Design from <a href="#">Maryland Institute College of Art</a> in 2010. My graduate research explored the role semiotic theory plays in the evolving language of design.</p>

  <p>I live in the beautiful mountainous city of Chattanooga, Tennessee with my partner Sally and our two ever-present cats.</p>
