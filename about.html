<div class="about-content">

  <p>I am a designer that loves working with people on projects that serve real user needs. My practice spans over 15 years working with a range of clients &mdash; from non-profits, small businesses, and startups, to universities, multicultural institutions, and Fortune 500 companies. The majority of that work has taken the form of digital products and services.</p>

  <p>My expertise and interests sit at the intersection of digital product design, research, and strategy. I try to leverage these disciplines to serve real user needs in a simple yet elegant way.</p>

  <p>I am currently in the midst of reorienting my design practice. Previously, I lead a design team at <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, the makers of <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, working across their portfolio of products on user research and user experience design initiatives. Prior to that I worked as a senior user experience designer and digital product lead at <a href="https://www.fastspot.com/">Fastspot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Readmill">Readmill</a>, respectively.</p>

  <p>I received my MFA in Graphic Design from <a href="https://www.mica.edu/Programs_of_Study/Graduate_Programs/Graphic_Design_(MFA).html">Maryland Institute College of Art</a> in 2010. My graduate research explored the role semiotic theory plays in the evolving language of design.</p>

  <p>I live in the beautiful mountainous city of Chattanooga, Tennessee with my partner Sally and our two ever-present cats.</p>
