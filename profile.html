    <p>I'm a consultant and digital product designer exploring the intersection of design and technology.  I'm particularly interested in applying traditional principles of graphic design to create modern design interfaces. Since 2006, I have partnered with startups, nonprofits, universities, cultural institutions, and organizations to design successful digital products and services from a process that is driven by user research.</p>

    <h3>Ethos</h3>
    <p>I am not an innovator or disruptor, thought leader or visionary, pixel pusher or creative.</p>
    <p>In the race for status and recognition, money and reputation, process has taken a backseat to pretense. I am a thinker — a graphic designer — seeking to subvert this tradition and restore the creative process inherent to design. It is process, not product, that creates. </p>

    <h3>Practice</h3>
    <p>While my background and capabilities span various modes of visual communication, my core expertise and interests reside in the disciplines that surround the digital landscape.</p>
    <p>I integrate user research and strategy into a conceptual approach to designing modern digital interfaces.</p>
    <p>I am independent, collaborative, and partner with clients who understand and advocate for the power of design.</p>
