   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve been here — in front of this screen trying to write something. It feels good, I think. I’m not gonna sit here and pretend that my relationship with writing has gotten better, and that that’s why I’m here again. My relationship is the same, but this time I’m a bit more confident. A bit more willing to try and make it work. To get better. To explore thoroughly and output honestly. There’s simply too much going on out there — inside and outside the design field — to quietly ignore. I need a place work it all out. A place that’s public, but still feels safe. Familiar. Comfortable and accepting. Well, accepting may be a bit of a stretch. Anyway, I’m excited about it regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site’s got some new skin and guts. They’re both pretty light, as it doesn’t need much. Like most personal sites, expect it to change over time — bit by bit. For now, though, enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;
