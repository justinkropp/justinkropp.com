The world of design has always had a precarious relationship with content &mdash; at times embracing it as an intrinsic part of our profession while at others decrying it for meddling in our precious form.

In the world of print, content has a finite life cycle. A concept and strategy is born. Through endless meetings and countless hours of editing, it grows and matures. In the end, the finalized content is handed over to a designer. She'll study it. Make notes and lists. Pull out keywords from the content in hopes of discovering a pattern of buried ideas from which to build a solid design direction. The designer will craft an armature of sorts, which allows her to shape the content—bringing it to life through her design. That content dies, in a manner of speaking, on the page. Think of it like Han Solo in carbonite, sans the ability to be unfrozen. There is no updating or maintaining content in the print realm. When the job is printed, it's done. Next project.

The relationship between the design and its content will always fail if it is simply a coexistence or cohabitation without interaction. One must communicate with the other. How can design faithfully serve content if it is blind to its partner? It can't.

The same is true when we bring design and content together onscreen. We must look at the overall project objectives and strategies in order to craft a designed experience that reflects those objectives and embodies those core strategies. As design professionals, it is our job to ensure that our concepts embrace and nurture the content from beginning to end. It all sounds quite "business-y" and, well, it is. Every project starts with a set of business goals. These goals are typically the result of identifying and studying some underlying problem that has arisen and needs to be addressed. Any time we are brought in to work with an individual, an institution, or an organization, we should approach the project not as a design team, but as a team of creative problem solvers, storytellers, and partners. It sounds cliché, but it's what we do. There's always a story to tell, and we must find innovative and compelling ways to allow that story to be told—in both the content strategy and the design.

In Kristina Halvorson's [Content Strategy for the Web](http://www.contentstrategy.com/), she points out that most project schedules put off the actual content development until the end, ultimately forcing bits and pieces of the story into places where they don't belong. Nothing good will come of this. Develop your content strategy in the very beginning of the project and make sure that all involved stakeholders understand that strategy. It is these stakeholders—essentially, the client—that will be responsible for continuing the content strategy that has been developed for them after the project launches. Unlike print, when the site launches the project is far from over. It grows and evolves. The content strategy, done right, can ensure that this growth is manageable, consistent, and effective. Every content strategy is unique and will involve a bit of client education. It's not only part of our job, but the client will appreciate that you have spent time giving them the knowledge that they will need to ensure and continue the project's success.

This is not to suggest that a solid content strategy is a silver bullet. On the contrary, developing and curating engaging content and implementing an effective strategy is just as important as the home within which it will live. The most successful projects are the ones that acknowledge that design and content are a mutual partnership.
