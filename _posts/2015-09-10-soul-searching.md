excerpt: After a somewhat lengthy hiatus from this site — as well as publishing anything in the digital aether — I'm back.

It’s been a while since I’ve been here — in front of this screen trying to write something. It feels good, I think. I’m not gonna sit here and pretend that my relationship with writing has gotten better, and that that’s why I’m here again. My relationship is the same, but this time I’m a bit more confident. A bit more willing to try and make it work. To get better. To explore thoroughly and output honestly. There’s simply too much going on out there — inside and outside the design field — to quietly ignore. I need a place work it all out. A place that’s public, but still feels safe. Familiar. Comfortable and accepting. Well, accepting may be a bit of a stretch. Anyway, I’m excited about it regardless.

The site’s got some new skin and guts. They’re both pretty light, as it doesn’t need much. Like most personal sites, expect it to change over time — bit by bit. For now, though, enjoy.
