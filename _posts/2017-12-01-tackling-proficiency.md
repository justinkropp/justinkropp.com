I was once asked during an interview how I go about staying up to date on changes in my field — from relevant news and research to new tools and methodologies. I responded that I practice daily and that practice takes the form of reading and experimentation, that is part of my job, and as such that practice is carried out during business hours. I went on to explain that I usually take a couple hours each day to read, write, and explore what I’ve read. My response was accepted, but somewhat apprehensively, which confounded me. It confounded me because I associate the above activities with professional growth, which benefits both myself and my employer. Furthermore, I view employment as an investment. Your employer is making an investment in you with the hope that you will deliver a good return on their investment. A competent investor will want to see growth.
