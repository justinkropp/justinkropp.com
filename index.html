          <h2>Profile</h2>
          <p>I’m a consultant and multidisciplinary designer, specializing in modern design for digital products and services. I have over 15 years  of experience partnering with startups, nonprofits, universities, cultural institutions and organizations — designing successful digital products from a process that is driven by user research. My work aims to solve problems, no matter their size, for clients who champion the power of design.</p>
          <p>I am a staunch advocate for adhering to a methodical process in design &mdash; a process that combines critical research, exploration, and play. I believe that process should never take a backseat to pretense.</p>
          <p>I am currently a Product Advisor at Spartan, a venture capital firm based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Most recently, I was a project manager and user experience designer with <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, the makers of <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a>. Previously, I was product design lead at <a href="http://readmill.com">Readmill</a>.</p>
