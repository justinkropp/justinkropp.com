            <h2>Who I am.</h2>
            <article>
              <p>Hi. My name is Justin Kropp. I’m a designer through and through. Digital product designer if you’re more attune with the parlance of today. I do other things, sure, but most of what I do day to day involves practicing the discipline of design.</p>
              <p>Aside from my work, I am an avid rock climber and cyclist. I also speak and write when I can. I do all these things from the scenic hills and mountains of Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p>

            <h2>What I do.</h2>
            <article>
              <p>I design solutions that solve problems, big and small. Most of these solutions exist on screens, big and small. I like to make things that people use; things that help affect positive change, even if that change is tiny. I believe that pursuing this kind of work is a worthy goal for my design practice &mdash; or any design practice for that matter. I’m not trying to change the world, put a dent in the universe, or whatever the current idiom is. I’m simply giving my utmost to do good work, for good people, on projects that matter.</p>

            <h2>What I've done.</h2>
            <article>
              <p>I've been around for a while (I'm old-ish). I was <em>Senior User Experience Designer</em> for a while at <a href="https://www.fastspot.com/">Fastspot</a> in Baltmore, Maryland. After that I moved to Berlin for a while to work on <a href="http://readmill.com/">Readmill</a> as the <em>Product Design Lead</em>. Most recently I've been working with <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> as a <em>User Experience Designer</em> and <em>Product Lead</em>. I'm a graduate of <a href="https://www.mica.edu/Programs_of_Study/Graduate_Programs/Graphic_Design_(MFA).html">Maryland Institute of Art</a> (MICA).</p>

            <h2>My writing.</h2>
            <article>
              <p>My writing is intermittent at best. Often nebulous. I blame the latter on the former. I write because it helps me better understand and refine my practice. It helps me explore why I continue to practice design. I’m not a good writer. I don’t even particularly enjoy it, but it is a necessity. Over the years I’ve used my writing to connect with design fellows whose work and ideology I admire. I like questions quite a bit; answers even more. These exchanges will continue, along with some periodical ramblings. You can find most of my writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@justinkropp">Medium</a>.</p>
