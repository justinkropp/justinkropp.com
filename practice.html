<div class="practice-content">

  <p>After 15 years of serving a range of clients as a digital product designer and user advocate, I am reorienting my practice to focus on leveraging the power of design to connect communities, empower people, and improve civic engagement.</p>

  <p>My time spent as a designer in more traditional client-service engagements and startup environments has been instrumental in shaping my career. I’ve learned more than I could’ve hoped for during that time and I am indebted to those who gave me the opportunity to help.</p>

  <p>I am now exploring opportunities that will allow me to leverage that experience and use design as a tool for the common good and to champion the power of design to affect positive change in the world around me.</p>
